I had a test task to complete under a month in 2017. The task was to create a mobile single-page application without a UI framework for a food delivery company. The application should have included ordering food, checkout process, order management, couriers' administration page. I learned a lot during this month - how SPA frameworks work, Node.js, Express, learned about NoSQL databases and used MongoDB, as it was more familiar to me then as a (not yet) junior javascript developer. I got hired as one of the first engineers at a small start-up as my first job.
